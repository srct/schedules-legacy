There are many things that can be done with this project (see the "To Do" section), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of contributing just a small spelling mistake.

If you need help at all please contact a SRCT member. We want people to contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn we are more than willing to help.

The project manager for this project is [Mark Stenglein](mstengle@gmu.edu), and a lead developer is [David Haynes](dhaynes3@gmu.edu).

## Setting everything up for development

These instructions are for Ubuntu and Debian, or related Linux distributions. (If you'd like to help write the instructions for Mac OSX, please do!)

### Prerequisities

On Ubuntu and Debian systems, setup is made super simple by the inclusion of a configuration script. Simply install git if you do not have it already, clone down the repository, and run the script. After the script finishes it will start the server in debug mode for you to see the site.

`sudo apt-get install git`

`git clone git@git.gmu.edu:srct/schedules.git`

`sudo ./configure.sh`

**Note:** To start the server easilly, simply go to the root folder of the project and type:

`./start.sh`

## Deployment


## To-do

The list of to-do items is kept track of on the gitlab Scheduels issues page. https://git.gmu.edu/srct/schedules/issues

Each issue includes details about the bugs and features, and links to documentation and tutorials to help with fixing that specific issue.

Contact the project manager or any of its developers if you'd like help picking an unassigned issue.
